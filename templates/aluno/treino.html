If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.","Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.","Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."],"level":"expert","mechanic":"compound","name":"Zercher Squats","primaryMuscles":["quadriceps"],"secondaryMuscles":["calves","glutes","hamstrings"]}]
